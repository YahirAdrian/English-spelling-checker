## Notice
This spelling checker does not check if the verb/noun/adjective has been input by the user is spelled correctly or the verb/noun/adjective has a real meaning in the dictionary. This tool only folllows the English's spelling rules.

In case of verbs, it does not check if the verb is regular or irregular verb. User must input and regular verb in its base form an they need to make sure it's a regular verb. The spelling cheker can't verify those user's issues.

As well, the the user has to input the adverb, adjcetve or noun correctly.
